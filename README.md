# ðŸš€ Hostphp  Setup Guide

This utility is very handy if you're doing some kind of **web development** from Termux, allowing you to easily manage your local PHP server.

## ðŸ›  Setup

### 1. Navigate to the `bin` directory

This ensures the script is placed where Termux looks for global commands.

```bash
cd $PREFIX/bin
```

2. Create the script file (hostp)
â€‹Use a text editor (like nano) to create and open the new file.
```bash
cd hostp
```
